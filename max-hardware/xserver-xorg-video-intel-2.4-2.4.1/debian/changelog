xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4 (2:2.4.1-1ubuntu11~ppa1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * rename the package to a new name, add conflicts/replaces to the old
    package name.
  * forward port of the intrepid version of the intel driver to jaunty.
  * 05_disable_dri_mm.patch:
    - make sure that DRI_MM stays disabled, even in jaunty. The memory
      managment feature wasn't enabled in intrepid and causes FTBFS in
      jaunty.
  * 30_unbreak_libdrm_sarea_renaming:
    - libdrm "fixes" an internal structure in this driver by renaming
      some members. This breaks compilation with this older version.

      EXA wasn't checking devKind in ModifyPixmapHeader, which
      makes it impossible to check homemade pixmaps (like produced
      by rotate_pixmap().  So this patch checks in all !965 cases now.
      965G supports max pitch for current exa limit (128k) so doesn't
      need checks.  (Closes LP: #174745)

  * Run dpkg-shlibdeps with --warnings=6.  Drivers reference symbols from

        compositing enabled
      + 02_xps1330_tvout_quirk.diff:

      + 05_fix_xv_reset.diff
        Playing Xv video after switching modes once the Xv driver is
        initialised causes a lockup, as the overlay regisers need
        re-programming. Ensure such a reset happens after a mode-switch.

        Emit the invariant 3D state to the GPU during EnterVT after
